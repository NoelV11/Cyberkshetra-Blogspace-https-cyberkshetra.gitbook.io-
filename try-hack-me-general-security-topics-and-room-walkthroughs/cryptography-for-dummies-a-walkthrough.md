# Cryptography for Dummies: A Walkthrough

![](<../.gitbook/assets/4 (2).png>)

Hello, blue teamers,

Well, well, well. What do we have here?

A Cryptography room, with hands-on exercises?

Count me in and join as we explore this room.

Room credits go to [tensio133](https://tryhackme.com/p/tensio133)

## Task 1 — Introduction&#x20;

Cryptography is a big topic. We are going to cover the basics, to give you a basic understanding.

It is used by a wide range of applications, almost everywhere on the internet.

### Why do we need cryptography?

Without encryption communications over the internet will be very insecure, and it would be very easy for someone to see your data. Fortunately, this isn’t true, and almost all of the data you get/send over the internet is encrypted and cannot be seen in plain text by someone who got access to it. Now let’s look into cryptography in more detail.

**Answer the questions below**

> Q) I understand why cryptography is important!

> A) No answer needed

## Task 2 — Types of Cryptography

There are two types of cryptography :

* Symmetric
* Asymmetric

### **What is symmetric cryptography?**

Let’s say Alice wants to send a message to Bob, but she doesn’t want to send the message in plain text because anyone can read it.

She has a recipe for how to mess up the letters in a way that no one can understand what it means(that is called **encryption**). Bob has the same recipe but he uses it to order them so it will become readable again(that is called **decryption**), and he will understand what Alice wrote. The recipe in cryptography is called a **key**. In symmetric cryptography, both users have the same key to encrypt and decrypt the messages.

### **What is asymmetric cryptography?**

In asymmetric cryptography the encryption and decryption keys are different. The encryption key can be used only for encryption, not for decryption, and vice versa. The encryption key is called the **Public key** and the decryption key is called the **Private key**.

**Why is asymmetric cryptography used?**

Well..because it’s more secure! If you are using symmetric cryptography and someone takes your key he can encrypt and decrypt messages that you send. While in asymmetric cryptography he can’t decrypt the messages you encrypted with the public key. Only the holder of the Private key can decrypt them. Let’s give an example :

1. Alice wants to talk to Google
2. Google gives Alice the Public key.
3. Alice encrypts her message with the public key and sends it to Google.
4. Google decrypts the message with his private key and sends back what Alice wanted.
5. And that’s how the conversation goes…

**Note: Symmetric cryptography is faster than asymmetric but asymmetric is more secure.**

Now let’s see what you’ve learned!

**Answer the questions below**

> Q) What type of cryptography is more secure?

> A) Asymmetric

> Q) What type of cryptography is faster?

> A) Symmetric

> Q) What type of cryptography will a Bank site use?

> A) Asymmetric

> Q) What will you use to encrypt your messages in asymmetric cryptography?

> A) Public Key

> Q) What will you use to decrypt messages in asymmetric cryptography?

> A) Private Key

> Q) Does symmetric cryptography use two different keys for encryption/decryption? (aye/nay)

> A) Nay

## Task 3 — What is a hash?

Hashes are long strings of letters and numbers generated by hashing algorithms. They take plain text and make it a hash.

The important thing about hashes is that **they are not reversible**. There’s no way to decrypt/decode a hash.

&#x20;                                              ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0\*rS\_ZVejdbG6zPxRM.png)

Popular hashing algorithms are MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm).

That’s how the word “hello” looks as MD5 hash : **5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592**

### **What are hashes used for?**

The most popular use of hashes is for file identification and storing sensitive data, like passwords. When you create an account on a website your password is converted to hash and this hash is stored in the server’s database. So when you log in the password that you type in will be converted to a hash, the server will take it and compare it with the hash in its database, if it’s the same that means your password is correct and the server will let you in.

MD5 hashes are also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because the MD5 hashing algorithm always produces the same output for the same given input, it can be used to compare a hash of the source file with a newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact and unmodified.

There are plenty of other hashing algorithms out there, but this room is intended for beginners so we’re not going to cover them here.

**Answer the questions below**

> Q) I understand what are hashes!

> A) No answer needed

> Q) What’s the MD5 hash of “hashes are cool”?

Let’s take the string “hashes are cool” and submit it in this [online utility](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com), to generate the MD5 hash.

We obtain the corresponding MD5 hash

> A) f762d32e3c160900d94b683e927555b9

> Q) What does MD5 stand for?

> A) Message Digest 5

> Q) Who created MD5?

Googling this up, we get the answer below

> A) Ronald Rivest

## Task 4 — Encoding/Decoding

There’s a difference between encoding and encrypting. Let’s say you have an encrypted file, the only way to decrypt it is using the key. While encoded data can be decoded immediately, without keys. It’s **NOT** a form of encryption, it's just a way of representing data.

A very popular encoding is Base64. Here’s how “hi there” looks with Base64 encoding: **aGkgdGhlcmU=**

**Answer the questions below**

> Q) Encode the string “cryptographyisuseful” with Base64

> Taking the similar approach from before, let’s make use of this [online utility](https://www.base64encoder.io) to encode the string to Base64

&#x20;                                          ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1\*QDFpZeXQsf\_pNXqNYdOQmw.png)

We get the base64 encoded code below

> A) Y3J5cHRvZ3JhcGh5aXN1c2VmdWw=

> Decode the string “dGhlIHNlY3JldCB3b3JkIGlzIDogd2F0ZXJtZWxvbg==”. What’s the secret word?

Let’s make use of Linux CLI for this task :)

There is a CLI utility command, that can allow us to decode base64 code

Copy the encoded code to a file and use the following command

```
base64 -d <name_of file>  >>  <name_of_file>
```

> where,

> \-d = decode

## Conclusion

Hope that you have grasped the basics of cryptography from this room. Skills in this field will help you when solving CTFs or when implementing security for websites and banks. Well that's a story for another day

Thank you for reading this blog and stay tuned as I try to close down more SOC alerts……

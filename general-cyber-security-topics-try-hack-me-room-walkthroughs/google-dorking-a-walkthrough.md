# Google Dorking:A Walkthrough

Hello



### Task 1 - Ye Ol' Search Engine

Google is arguably the most famous example of “Search Engines”, I mean who remembers Ask Jeeves? _shudders_

Now it might be rather patronising explaining how these “Search Engines” work, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes then what we see. More importantly, we can leverage this to our advantage to find all sorts of things that a wordlist wouldn’t. Researching as a whole - especially in the context of Cybersecurity encapsulates almost everything you do as a pentester. [MuirlandOracle](https://tryhackme.com/p/MuirlandOracle) has created a [fantastic room](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoresearch) on learning the attitudes towards how to research, and what information you can gain from it exactly.

"Search Engines" such as Google are huge indexers – specifically, indexers of content spread across the World Wide Web.

These essentials in surfing the internet use “Crawlers” or “Spiders” to search for this content across the World Wide Web, which I will discuss in the next task

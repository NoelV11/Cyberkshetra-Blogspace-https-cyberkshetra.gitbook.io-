You may have lost count of the number of times that you have heard of this old proverb — “An apple a day, keeps the doctor away”. When pondering more about it, little do we realize that it is pretty applicable in the modern Cyber fueled world.&#x20;

The industry has a common myth of being a cat and mouse game, between hackers and the good guys(there is much more to cyber).In today’s era, it is of paramount importance to maintain good cyber hygiene.&#x20;

## Tips to up your Cyber Safety game

1. Install a reputed antivirus across all devices — make sure to update it regularly to ensure real-time protection&#x20;
2. A good strong password beats a weak one every day — Its minimum length should be 8 characters — with special characters and numbers included. Examples include - Bitwarden and Lastpass&#x20;
3. Never reuse passwords across different sites — use a password generator for the same&#x20;
4. Backups should be maintained mandatorily — Have an on-site and off-site solution. Use a hard drive, USB to keep backups at hand, and cloud storage. The rule of thumb is to have 3 backups - 1 offsite and 2 copies&#x20;

5\. Update your devices — these include installing drivers and software updates to mitigate security threats and risks&#x20;

6\. Use 2MFA or an authenticator app to supplement your authentication security. These are widely supported across sites.&#x20;

7\. Use a password manager to store your passwords, not your browser. They should have backup functionality and provide support across multiple devices.&#x20;

8\. Never neglect the importance of email filters. If you tend to receive phishy or spammy-looking mails, apply a filter to block emails. Identify keywords and blocklist them — to block other mails containing the same words&#x20;

10\. Delete old accounts that you no longer use. A major cause of PII leakage is the existence of such accounts, which are available for anyone to view on the Internet Keep yourselves safe and keep the internet baddies away.

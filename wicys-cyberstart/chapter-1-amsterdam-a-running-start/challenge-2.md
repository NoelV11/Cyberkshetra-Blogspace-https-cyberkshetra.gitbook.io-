## Briefing L01 C02

> Mixed Up Messages We’ve been informed that a group of hackers are communicating cryptically on a social media site.

> Their messages have been getting increasingly cryptic; so much so that all of the posts now look jumbled up and don’t seem to make any sense!

> We’ve found one post that we believe contains an important secret, and we need you to find out what that secret is so we can be ready to stop a possible cyber attack!

> **Tip**: The secret is the flag.\

Let's go to the challenge

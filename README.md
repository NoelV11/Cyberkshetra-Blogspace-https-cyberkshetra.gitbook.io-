# Welcome to my Gitbooks Page

A word from the author:-&#x20;

👋Thank you for visiting my Gitbooks page, where I host my personalized walkthroughs of machines that I solve on the Let's Defend and Cyber Defenders platforms

😃 I am Noel Varghese, a Cybersecurity enthusiast - having experience in Secure Coding, OSINT, Pentesting & Threat Intelligence fields, having taken part in Internships, training, and competitions in these. I am an undergraduate student pursuing Btech in CSE specialization in Cyber Security, at Vellore Institute of Technology, Bhopal.&#x20;

💡Now, I am branching my journey towards Blue Teaming, where I will be documenting my journey and cases I solve on LetsDefend,Try Hack Me & Rangeforce platforms,on this blog

🔆 Having previous experience in pentesting will prove beneficial as I seek to identify suspicious activity and understand the methodologies exhibited by the malicious actor, to wreak havoc on computer systems, during my blue teaming journey.

​👨‍💻️ Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia

🕵 Contributed to Darkwebathon,hosted by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (@TeamATII).During this event,we the help of a 200+ search party scoured the Dark Web,pulled information from tools like Project Hades and Maltego,to identify individuals who operate in gambling,child porn and CSAM rings

👱 Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it

🎇 I am an advocate for incorporating women into the field of Cyber Security,owing to remove the gate barriers that they face.This led me to be a member of my University's Women in Cyber Security (WiCYS) Chapter.I try to contribute,to the best of my ability,for the good of this organization

💭 Empowering them,by sharing nuggets of knowlege and providing them opportunities to forster their growth gives me immense joy

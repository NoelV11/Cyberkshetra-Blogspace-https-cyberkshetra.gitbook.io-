A word from the author:-&#x20;

Thank you for visiting my Gitbooks page,where I host my personalized case walkthroughs, as I solve cases on LetsDefend and CyberDefenders platforms

I am Noel Varghese,a Cybersecurity enthusiast - having experience in Secure Coding,OSINT,Pentesting & Threat Intelligence fields-having taken part in training,internships and competitions in these.

Having previous experience in pentesting,will prove beneficial as I seek to identify suspicious activity and understand the methodologies exhibited by the malicious actor,to wreck havoc on computer systems,during my blue teaming journey.

Retaining an interest in Secure Coding, I have participated in University level Secure Coding Tournaments, achieving 3'rd rank in OWASP Bangalore Chapter and 38'th rank in Devlymics Champions Tournament, conducted by Secure Code Warriors, Australia

Contributed to Darkwebathon,hosted by the [Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (@TeamATII)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/anti-human-trafficking-intelligence-initiative/).During this event,we the help of a 200+ search party scoured the Dark Web,pulled information from tools like Project Hades and Maltego,to identify individuals who operate in gambling,child porn and CSAM rings\
\
We did so by reverse searching SSH Keys,Email and Bitcoin addresses of these individuals, present on the Dark Web.We are proud of what we did,helping Law Enforcement to book these criminals to jail.\


Cyber Security interests me as an individual, being the subject I am majoring in. Finding new techniques to enforce security in everyday life, and resisting attack attempts is thrilling and requires a whole lot of collective efforts from security professionals and general citizens, to make the world a much secure place. I would very much want to be a part of it
